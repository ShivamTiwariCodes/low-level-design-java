# This repository contains some basic Design patterns
### For running any design pattern demo, just provide the design pattern name in designPatternName variable in main file. Avaialable design patterns name are :

Hereâ€™s your list with the **type of design pattern** (Creational, Structural, Behavioral) and a **short reason** for each:

---

#### AbstractFactoryDesignPatternDemo *(Creational)*
> Used to create families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.

#### AdaptorDesignPatternDemo *(Structural)*
> Allows incompatible interfaces to work together by converting one interface into another.

#### BridgeDesignPatternDemo *(Structural)*
> Decouples abstraction from implementation so that the two can vary independently.

#### BuilderDesignPatternDemo *(Creational)*
> Constructs complex objects step by step, separating construction from representation.

#### ChainOfResponsibilityDemo *(Behavioral)*
> Passes a request along a chain of handlers until one handles it.

#### CommandDesignPatternDemo *(Behavioral)*
> Encapsulates a request as an object, allowing parameterization and queuing of requests.

#### CompositeDesignPatternDemo *(Structural)*
> Composes objects into tree structures and treats individual and compositions uniformly.

#### DecoratorDesignPatternDemo *(Structural)*
> Adds new behaviors to objects dynamically without altering their structure.

#### FacadeDesignPatternDemo *(Structural)*
> Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.

#### FactoryDeisgnPatternDemo *(Creational)*
> Defines an interface for creating objects but lets subclasses alter the type of objects created.

#### FlyweightPatternDemo *(Structural)*
> Reduces memory usage by sharing common parts of state between multiple objects.

#### InterpreterDesignPatternDemo *(Behavioral)*
> Provides a way to evaluate language grammar or expression.

#### IteratorDesignPatternDemo *(Behavioral)*
> Provides a way to access elements of a collection sequentially without exposing the underlying representation.

#### MediatorDesignPatternDemo *(Behavioral)*
> Reduces the communication complexity between objects by centralizing control logic.

#### MomentoDesignPatternDemo *(Behavioral)*
> Captures and restores an object's internal state without violating encapsulation.

#### NullObjectPatternDemo *(Behavioral)*
> Provides a default behavior in place of null references, avoiding null checks.

#### ObserverDesignPatternDemo *(Behavioral)*
> Defines a one-to-many dependency so that when one object changes state, all dependents are notified.

#### PrototypeDesignPatternDemo *(Creational)*
> Creates new objects by copying an existing object, known as the prototype.

#### ProxyPatternDemo *(Structural)*
> Provides a surrogate or placeholder to control access to another object.

#### SingletonDesignPatternDemo *(Creational)*
> Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

#### StateDesignPatternDemo *(Behavioral)*
> Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.

#### StrategyPattern *(Behavioral)*
> Enables selecting an algorithm's behavior at runtime by encapsulating it.

#### TemplateMethodPatternDemo *(Behavioral)*
> Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses.

#### VisitorDesignPatternDemo *(Behavioral)*
> Separates an algorithm from the object structure it operates on.
